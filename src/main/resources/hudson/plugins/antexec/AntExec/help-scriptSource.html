    Runs entered Apache Ant tasks as a build file with only one target, untill you write code into the "Extended script
    source", but the target created from this <b>code will always be the default target of the created build file</b>.
    <br><br>
    The script will run with WORKSPACE as the current directory. Build will be considered as failure if any Ant task
    fails. You can use <a href="http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/tasks/tasks/index.html">Ant-Contrib tasks</a>
    (if it is enabled in global configuration). You need to use namespace "antcontrib" (example: "&lt;antcontrib:if&gt;").
